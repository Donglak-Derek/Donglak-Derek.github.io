- Hi! I am Derek Han.
	I am a Full stack web developer based on UI/UX design.

	but I am very interested in developing mobile applications, too.

THANKS!

## TODO
- Use Framework - too complecated
- Add carousel on Portfolio to show without going to other pages.
- Make tech section clearer 
- each titles are too ugly
